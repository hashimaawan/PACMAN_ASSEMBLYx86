/---------------------------   DESCRIBING THE GAME     ----------------------------------/

The game is designed in a pacman-style format, featuring background music.
The game maze consists of both enemies (represented by 'E') and the player (represented by 'P'). 
Additionally, there are bonuses and hidden paths introduced in later levels.
Food items are represented by '*'. These items are stored in arrays.
We monitor the player's position, and when the player's coordinates match those of a food item, we update the player's score accordingly.
